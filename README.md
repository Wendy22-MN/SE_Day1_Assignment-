**#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
- software engineeing is the process of designing, developing and maintaining software. Software engineering ensures high-quality software on time and within a budget, it improves business efiiefficiency and productivity, and it reduces costs.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.** 
- Mastering the Machine
  Code development was strongly influenced by outside forces. The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources. The first compilers were defined; operating systems were noninteractive. These primitive environments continued evolving up to the definition of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools (CASE tools) facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging. The lack of software development methods led to high risk and the origin of a new stage is easily noticeable.
- Mastering the Process
  The first software crisis in this stage led to the birth of software engineering [1]. The aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modeling approach that enables implementation automation.
- Mastering the Complexity
  The up to then dominion of hardware over software ended. Personal computers arrived and opened the fields of computer applications. The software development process would now comprehensively address analysis and design from the specification. Graphical user interface and visual programming brought software closer to customers.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
-Planning
planning is a vital role in the software delivery lifecycle since this is the part where the team estimates the cost and defines the requirements of the new software.
-define requirements
The second step of SDLC is gathering maximum information from the client requirements for the product. Discuss each detail and specification of the product with the customer. The development team will then analyze the requirements keeping the design and code of the software in mind.
-design
The program developer scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end-user and if the project is feasible for the customer technologically, practically, and financially
-implementation
 Translating the design to a computer-legible language(coding)
-testing
Once the developers build the software, then it is deployed in the testing environment. Then the testing team tests the functionality of the entire system. 
-deployment 
 Once the testing is done, and the product is ready for deployment, it is released for customers to use.
-maintenance 
The actual problem starts when the customer actually starts using the developed system and those needs to be solved from time to time. Maintenance is the seventh phase of SDLC where the developed product is taken care of. According to the changing user end environment or technology, the software is updated timely.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
Agile is an iterative approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration among cross-functional teams. It focuses on delivering small, incremental releases, adapting to changes throughout the development process
Example: Building a new mobile app. Since user preferences can change, developers can adjust features based on feedback instead of following a fixed plan.

Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach to software development, with distinct phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
Example: Developing a medical records system for hospitals. Since healthcare software must follow strict regulations, detailed planning and thorough testing are essential before release.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
1. Unit Testing
Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a program in isolation to ensure they work correctly. Developers typically write these tests while coding.
It Catches bugs early in development, helps developers ensure each part of the code works as expected and makes debugging easier by isolating faulty components.

2. Integration Testing
Integration testing checks whether different modules or components of a system work together properly. It ensures that data flows correctly between different parts of the software.
It ensures seamless communication between different software components, helps detect issues in data exchange or API interactions and prevents integration failures that could break the system.

3. System Testing
System testing evaluates the complete software system as a whole to check if it meets the specified requirements. It tests the entire application in an environment that simulates real-world conditions.
It verifies that the entire system functions as expected, identifies performance, security, and usability issues, and ensures compliance with business requirements.

4. Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing determines whether the software is ready for release by validating it against business and user requirements. It is usually performed by the end user or client.
It confirms that the software meets user expectations, reduces the risk of failure after deployment and ensures that the final product is user-friendly and reliable

**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
- Promt engineering is the art if crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models. Prompt engineers play a crucial role in reducing biases in AI outputs, which can arise from the training data or the phrasing of the prompts themselves. Strategies include: Neutral prompt design: Avoid leading questions or prompts that might predispose the model to generate biased responses
  
**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
Vague Prompt:
"Write about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Write an essay on how artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare. Discuss its role in diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, and include real-world examples. Also, explore both the benefits and challenges of using AI in the medical field."

Why This is Better:
The improved prompt is much clearer because it tells me exactly what to focus on—AI in healthcare. It also gives me specific areas to discuss, like diagnosis and patient care, which makes it easier to organize my thoughts. Plus, by asking for real-world examples and both benefits and challenges, it ensures the essay is more balanced and informative.
